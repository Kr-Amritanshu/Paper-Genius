I want you to build a **full-stack AI Research Paper Generator web application** using React.js for frontend and Node.js (Express) for backend. 
The app should allow a user to:

1. Input a research topic in a text field.
2. Generate a full research paper using OpenAI GPT-5 mini (or GPT-4) with:
   - Sections: Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.
   - Authentic references from real research papers (use Semantic Scholar API to fetch papers, include titles, authors, year, DOI).
   - Proper citations in the text referencing the fetched papers.
3. Generate a **downloadable PDF** of the paper with proper formatting, including all sections and references.

**Requirements:**

**Frontend (React + Tailwind):**
- Input box for topic.
- Generate button.
- Optional: Preview of generated paper.
- Download button for PDF.

**Backend (Node.js + Express):**
- Endpoint `/api/generate` to:
  - Accept topic from frontend.
  - Fetch real references via Semantic Scholar API.
  - Send prompt to OpenAI GPT-5 mini for paper generation with references.
  - Generate a downloadable PDF using pdf-lib.
- Send the PDF back to the frontend for download.

**Backend Details:**
- Use environment variable for OpenAI API key.
- Structure project folders as:
  - `/routes` for API routes
  - `/services` for LLM and reference fetching
  - `/utils` for PDF generation

**PDF Generation:**
- Title at top
- Sections with headings and content
- References formatted clearly

**Coding Requirements:**
- Clean, production-ready code.
- Include comments for clarity.
- Include package.json with all dependencies.
- Include instructions to run locally: `npm install` and `npm start`.

**Extra Features (Optional but preferred):**
- Multiple citation styles (APA, IEEE)
- Section preview before download
- Placeholder for figures/tables

**Output:**
- Provide all frontend and backend code.
- Provide instructions to run the project locally.
- Include any necessary setup for environment variables.

Please generate **all files and folders required for this project** so it can be run directly on Replit.
